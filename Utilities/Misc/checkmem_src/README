! Safe memory allocation test in clusters:

! checkmem.f90 : Increases the memory usage in a system by allocating large arrays of reals.
! When RAM and Swap memory are overrun the ChkMemErr subroutine will throw an allocation error and stop.

Compile with:
$ ifort -O0 -g checkmem.f90

Submit, for example, in batch3 of blaze with:
$ srun -n 1 -p batch3 a.out

This is the result:
